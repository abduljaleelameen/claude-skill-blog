# NeuralFlow Landing Page

A stunning, production-ready SaaS landing page built using the frontend-design-enhancer Claude skill.

## Design Philosophy

This landing page breaks free from generic "AI slop" aesthetics by implementing distinctive design across four key dimensions:

### 1. Typography
- **Display:** Space Grotesk (bold, tech-forward)
- **Body:** Work Sans (clean, readable)
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono (for code snippets)

### 2. Themes & Colors
- **Aesthetic:** Dark Cyberpunk/Modern Tech
- **Primary:** Electric cyan (#00D9FF)
- **Secondary:** Neon purple (#A855F7)
- **Tertiary:** Emerald green (#10B981)
- **Background:** Deep slate with animated gradients

### 3. Motion & Animation
- Staggered fade-in animations on page load
- Floating CTA button with glow effects
- Animated gradient mesh background
- Interactive hover states with scale and glow
- Pulse animations on key elements

### 4. Backgrounds & Visual Details
